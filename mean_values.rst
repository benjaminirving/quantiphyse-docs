Mean value widget
=================

The mean values widget takes the current overlay and current ROI and outputs a new overlay. Within each ROI
region, the new overlay contains the mean value of the original overlay within that region.

This is particularly useful with ROIs generated by clustering or supervoxel methods as it enables the generation
of a simplified version of the overlay where each supervoxel has a single value.
